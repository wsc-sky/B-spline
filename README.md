//B-spline Instruction

Compiling platform: Mac OS X

Programming tool: xcode7.3

How to run and compile(please run in UNIX): 

First open my project file: mesh_project, 

The project in xcode must include these frameworks:

GLUT.framework.

Remark: the last two are use to nfd

you can open the project in xcode in: /build/project/ B-spline.xcodeproj

please set your file path at the function 'readFile' in main(), so that you can run the B-spline. 

My kernel code is in /B-spline/ main.cpp.
